title:  "Arduino Weather Shield"
---

Last week, I met up with some friends (and made some new friends) at [Interdrone](https://www.interdrone.com). On the show floor, [TE Connectivity](https://www.te.com/usa-en/home.html) gave out some [Arduino Weather Shields](https://www.te.com/usa-en/product-10212634-00.html). This weather shield has five different sensors: 

    - HTU21D Humidity sensor
    - MS5637 Barometric Pressure sensor
    - TSYS01 Temperature sensor
    - MS8607 Humidity and Pressure sensor
    - TSD305-1C55 Termopile sensor

I thought it'd be an interesting project to use all of these sensors for a simple weather station I could place outside my house.
